# DAX Formulas for Relative Performance Analysis
&nbsp;
## Problem Description
This repository contains examples of DAX formulas used to compare the performance of an entity (such as a country, category, productm post, or others) against the best-performing entity in the dataset. These formulas can be useful in reporting scenarios where relative performance needs to be highlighted.

## DAX Code - Example
### Sales Relative to Best Country
This DAX formula calculates the sales of a country relative to the country with the highest sales. It identifies the top-performing country in terms of sales and then divides the current country's sales by this value.

```bash
Ventas Con Respecto a Mejor Pa√≠s = 
VAR VentasDelMayorPais =
CALCULATE(
    [Ventas],
    TOPN(
        1,
        SUMMARIZE(
            ALL(dPaises),
            dPaises[Pais]
        ),
        [Ventas],
        DESC
    )
)

RETURN
DIVIDE(
    [Ventas],
    VentasDelMayorPais
)
```
&nbsp;
### Post Performance Vs Best Post Performance
This DAX formula calculates the performance of a post on Social Media relative to the post with the highest total interactions. It identifies the post with the most interactions and then divides the current post's interactions by this value.

```bash
Post Performance Vs Best Post Performance = 
VAR BestPostPerform =
CALCULATE(
    [Post Total Interactions],
    TOPN(
        1,
        SUMMARIZE(
            ALL(fPostsInsights),
            fPostsInsights[Post Name]
        ),
        [Post Total Interactions],
        DESC
    )
)

RETURN
DIVIDE(
    [Post Total Interactions],
    BestPostPerform
)
```

## Solution DAX Code - Generic Case
This generic DAX formula calculates the performance of any entity relative to the best-performing entity in a dataset. Replace Metric with the specific measure you are evaluating, and EntitiesTable and EntityName with the relevant table and column names.

```bash
Performance Relative to Best Entity = 
VAR BestEntityPerformance =
CALCULATE(
    [Metric],
    TOPN(
        1,
        SUMMARIZE(
            ALL(EntitiesTable),
            EntitiesTable[EntityName]
        ),
        [Metric],
        DESC
    )
)

RETURN
DIVIDE(
    [Metric],
    BestEntityPerformance
)
```

## Examples of Use Cases
üìä Compare the sales performance of different regions against the top-performing region.

üìà Measure the engagement of social media posts relative to the best-performing post.

üè¢ Evaluate department performance within a company compared to the highest-performing department.

üìÖ Track monthly performance metrics against the highest-performing month.
