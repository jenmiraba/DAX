# Power BI Row-Level Data Masking for Design Access 
## Overview
This repository contains a DAX formula for data masking, allowing access to report designers while hiding sensitive business data (shows all BLANK). This approach enables designers to work on the visual aspects and layout of the report without exposing actual data values.
&nbsp;
## Purpose of the Formula
The DAX measure creates a conditional data masking system that shows blank values based on the user's email address, effectively creating a "design-only" view of the report.
&nbsp;
## Business Use Cases ðŸŽ¯
- ðŸŽ¨ External consultants need to redesign reports without accessing sensitive company data
- ðŸ‘¥ UX designers working on report layouts and aesthetics
- ðŸ”„ Report template creation by third-party vendors
- ðŸ“Š Training environments where data structure needs to be preserved but actual values hidden 

## Generic Code for RLS
```
USERPRINCIPALNAME() <> "ALLOWED_EMAIL"
``` 
## Example
```
USERPRINCIPALNAME() <> "designer@company.com"
``` 

## Notes
- Create a Row Level Security in Power BI Desktop using the code above.
- Replace `ALLOWED_EMAIL` with the email address of the user who should not see the actual data
- This formula can be adapted for multiple users by using the IN operator: 
  &nbsp;
  ```
  USERPRINCIPALNAME() IN {"email1", "email2", "email3"}
  ```
