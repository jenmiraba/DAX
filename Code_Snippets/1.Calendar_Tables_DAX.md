# Calendar Tables in DAX

## Overview

While data modeling in Power BI, having a robust and flexible calendar table is essential. A calendar table, or date dimension, allows for consistent and accurate time-based analysis. It enables users to perform calculations such as year-over-year growth, month-to-date sales, or quarter comparisons, which are crucial for insightful reporting and data analysis. This repository provides examples of calendar tables in DAX, one in English and another in Spanish, to assist you in building and customizing your own date dimension table.

## English Calendar Table 
```bash
dCalendar = 

VAR MinYear =
    YEAR(MIN('Table'[Date]))
    
VAR MaxYear =
    YEAR(MAX('Table'[Date]))

RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        FILTER(
            CALENDARAUTO(),
            YEAR([Date]) >= MinYear
                && YEAR([Date]) <= MaxYear
        ),
        "Year", YEAR([Date]),
        "Year-Month", YEAR([Date]) & "-" & FORMAT(MONTH([Date]), "00"),
        "Quarter Number", INT(FORMAT([Date], "q")),
        "Quarter", "Q" & INT(FORMAT([Date], "q")),
        "Month Number", MONTH([Date]),
        "Month Short", FORMAT([Date], "mmm"),
        "Semester", "S" & INT(IF(MONTH([Date]) >= 7, "2", "1")),
        "Week Number", WEEKNUM([Date]),
        "Week Day Number", WEEKDAY([Date], 2), // Week Starts Monday
        "Week Day Name", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
        "Weekend", IF(WEEKDAY([Date], 2) IN {6, 7}, "Y", "N")
    )
```
    
## Spanish Calendar Table
```bash
dCalendario = 

VAR MinYear =
    YEAR(MIN('Table'[Date]))
    
VAR MaxYear =
    YEAR(MAX('Table'[Date]))

RETURN
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        FILTER(
            CALENDARAUTO(),
            YEAR([Date]) >= MinYear
                && YEAR([Date]) <= MaxYear
        ),
        "Año", YEAR([Date]),
        "Año-Mes", YEAR([Date]) & "-" & MONTH([Date]),
        "#Trimestre", INT(FORMAT([Date], "q")),
        "Trimestre", "T" & INT(FORMAT([Date], "q")),
        "#Mes", MONTH([Date]),
        "Mes", FORMAT([Date], "MMM"),
        "Semestre", "S" & INT(IF(MONTH([Date]) >= 7, "2", "1")),
        "Semana", WEEKNUM([Date]),
        "#Día Semana", WEEKDAY([Date], 2), // Semana Comienza Lunes y Termina Domingo
        "Día Semana", FORMAT([Date], "dddd"),
        "Fin de Semana", IF(WEEKDAY([Date], 2) IN {6, 7}, "Si", "No")
    )

```

## Notes
- The above calendar tables include common columns such as year, month, quarter, and day information, which are frequently used in time-based analysis.

- These tables can be extended to include additional custom columns or to exclude columns that are not needed for your specific analysis.

- Customizations might include fiscal year information, holiday flags, special event markers, or any other date-related data that is relevant to your business needs.
