# DAX Time Dimension Tables

## Overview
This repository contains two DAX formulas for creating time dimension tables in Power BI: a comprehensive version with detailed time breakdowns and a simplified basic version.

## Comprehensive Time Table
### Purpose
Creates a detailed time dimension table with hours, minutes, seconds, time periods, and interval markers.

### Business Use Cases 🎯
- 📊 Time-based sales analysis across different periods of the day
- 🏭 Manufacturing shift monitoring and performance tracking
- 📱 Call center activity patterns analysis
- 🚚 Logistics and delivery time optimization

### Generic Code
```dax
TimeTable = 
VAR TimeBase = 
    SELECTCOLUMNS (
        GENERATESERIES (StartTime, EndTime, Increment),
        "TimeColumn", [Value]
    )
VAR ResultTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        TimeBase,
        "Hour", HOUR([TimeColumn]),
        "Minute", MINUTE([TimeColumn]),
        "Second", SECOND([TimeColumn]),
        "DayPeriod",
            SWITCH (
                TRUE(),
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= EveningHour, "Night",
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= AfternoonHour, "Afternoon",
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= MorningHour, "Morning",
                "Night"
            ),
        "HourStart", TIME(HOUR([TimeColumn]), 0, 0),
        "ThirtyMinInterval",
            TIME(
                HOUR([TimeColumn]), 
                30 * ROUNDDOWN(MINUTE([TimeColumn]) / 30, 0), 
                0
            ),
        "FifteenMinInterval",
            TIME(
                HOUR([TimeColumn]), 
                15 * ROUNDDOWN(MINUTE([TimeColumn]) / 15, 0), 
                0
            )
    )
RETURN
    ResultTable
```

## Basic Time Table
### Purpose
Creates a simple time dimension table using cross-joins for basic time analysis.

### Business Use Cases 🎯
- 📈 Basic time-based reporting
- 🕒 Simple scheduling systems
- 📊 Hourly data aggregation

### Generic Code
```dax
BasicTimeTable = 
VAR Hours = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartHour, EndHour), "Hour", [Value])
VAR Minutes = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartMin, EndMin), "Minute", [Value])
VAR Seconds = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartSec, EndSec), "Second", [Value])

VAR ResultTable =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CROSSJOIN(Hours, Minutes, Seconds),
    "TimeValue", TIME([Hour], [Minute], [Second])
)
RETURN
    ResultTable
```

## Notes
- Adjust time intervals by modifying the GENERATESERIES parameters
- Time periods (Morning/Afternoon/Night) can be customized by changing the hour thresholds
- For better performance in large datasets, consider using the basic version
- Both formulas can be modified to include additional custom time-related calculations
- When using the comprehensive version, memory usage should be considered due to second-level granularity
