# DAX Time Dimension Tables

## Overview
This repository contains two DAX formulas for creating time dimension tables in Power BI: a version with detailed time breakdowns and a simplified basic version. They serve as foundational utilities for building time-based analytics, including categorizing moments of the day or creating granular time tables for analysis.

## Comprehensive Time Table
### Purpose
Creates a detailed time dimension table with hours, minutes, seconds, time periods, and interval markers.

### Use Cases 🎯
- 📊 Time-based sales analysis across different periods of the day
- 🏭 Manufacturing shift monitoring and performance tracking
- 📱 Call center activity patterns analysis
- 🚚 Logistics and delivery time optimization
- ⚡ Morning vs. Night analysis
- 🤖 IoT sensor data analysis
- 🎉 Identify peak support hours by analyzing tickets resolved at different times of the day.

### Generic Code
```dax
TimeTable = 
VAR TimeBase = 
    SELECTCOLUMNS (
        TIME(0, 0, 0), TIME(23, 59, 59), TIME(0, 0, 1),
        "TimeColumn", [Value]
    )

VAR ResultTable =
    ADDCOLUMNS(
        TimeBase,
        "Hour", HOUR([TimeColumn]),
        "Minute", MINUTE([TimeColumn]),
        "Second", SECOND([TimeColumn]),
        "DayPeriod",
            SWITCH (
                TRUE(),
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= 18, "Night",
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= 12, "Afternoon",
                HOUR([TimeColumn]) >= 6, "Morning",
                "Night"
            ),
        "HourStart", TIME(HOUR([TimeColumn]), 0, 0),
        "ThirtyMinInterval",
            TIME(
                HOUR([TimeColumn]), 
                30 * ROUNDDOWN(MINUTE([TimeColumn]) / 30, 0), 
                0
            ),
        "FifteenMinInterval",
            TIME(
                HOUR([TimeColumn]), 
                15 * ROUNDDOWN(MINUTE([TimeColumn]) / 15, 0), 
                0
            )
    )
RETURN
    ResultTable
```

## Basic Time Table
### Purpose
Creates a simple time dimension table using cross-joins for basic time analysis.

### Business Use Cases 🎯
- 📈 Basic time-based reporting
- 🕒 Simple scheduling systems
- 📊 Hourly data aggregation

### Generic Code
```dax
BasicTimeTable = 
VAR Hours = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartHour, EndHour), "Hour", [Value])
VAR Minutes = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartMin, EndMin), "Minute", [Value])
VAR Seconds = SELECTCOLUMNS(GENERATESERIES(StartSec, EndSec), "Second", [Value])

VAR ResultTable =
ADDCOLUMNS(
    CROSSJOIN(Hours, Minutes, Seconds),
    "TimeValue", TIME([Hour], [Minute], [Second])
)
RETURN
    ResultTable
```

## Notes
- Adjust granularity by modifying the GENERATESERIES parameters
- Time periods (Morning/Afternoon/Night) can be customized by changing the hour thresholds
- Both formulas can be modified to include additional custom time-related calculations
- Be cautious when generating very granular tables (e.g., second-by-second) as they can be resource-intensive in large datasets.
