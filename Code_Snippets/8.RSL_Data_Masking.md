# Power BI Row-Level Data Masking for Design Access

## Overview
This repository contains a DAX formula implementation for data masking in Power BI reports, allowing you to grant access to report designers while hiding sensitive business data. This approach enables designers to work on the visual aspects and layout of the report without exposing actual data values.

## Purpose of the Formula
The DAX measure creates a conditional data masking system that shows blank values based on the user's email address, effectively creating a "design-only" view of the report.

## Business Use Cases ðŸŽ¯
- ðŸŽ¨ External consultants need to redesign reports without accessing sensitive company data
- ðŸ‘¥ UX designers working on report layouts and aesthetics
- ðŸ”„ Report template creation by third-party vendors
- ðŸ“Š Training environments where data structure needs to be preserved but actual values hidden

## Generic Code
```
MeasureName = 
IF(
    USERPRINCIPALNAME() <> "ALLOWED_EMAIL",
    BLANK(),
    [Original_Measure]
)
```

## Example of Code
```
Sales_Masked = 
IF(
    USERPRINCIPALNAME() <> "designer@company.com",
    BLANK(),
    [Total_Sales]
)
```

## Notes
- Replace `ALLOWED_EMAIL` with the email address of the user who should see the actual data
- Apply this pattern to each measure that needs to be masked
- This formula can be adapted for multiple users by using the IN operator:
  ```
  USERPRINCIPALNAME() IN {"email1", "email2", "email3"}
  ```
- The formula preserves the original data structure while only masking the values
- Remember to implement this masking on all sensitive measures to ensure complete data privacy
- This approach works with Row-Level Security (RLS) if already implemented
